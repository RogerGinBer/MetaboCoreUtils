#' @title Convert migration times to effective mobility
#'
#' @description
#'
#' `convertMtime` performs effective mobility scale transformation of CE(-MS) 
#' data, which is used to overcome variations of the migration times, caused by 
#' differences in the Electroosmotic Flow (EOF) between different runs. 
#' In order to monitor the EOF and perform the transformation, neutral or 
#' charged EOF markers are spiked into the sample before analysis. The 
#' information of the EOF markers (migration time and effective mobility) will 
#' be then used to perform the  effective mobility transformation of the 
#' migration time scale. 
#'
#' @param x `numeric` vector with migration times in minutes.
#'
#' @param rtime `numeric` vector that holds the migration times (in minutes) of 
#' either one or two EOF markers in the same run of which the migration time is 
#' going to be transformed.
#' 
#' @param mobility `numeric` vector containing the respective effective mobility
#' (in in mm^2 / (kV * min)) of the EOF markers. If two markers are used, one is
#' expected to be the neutral marker, i.e. having a mobility of 0. 
#' 
#' @param tR `numeric` a single value that defines the time (in minutes) of the 
#' electrical field ramp. The default is 0. 
#' 
#' @param U `numeric` a single value that defines the voltage (in kV) applied. 
#' Note that for reversed polarity CE mode a negative value is needed. Is only 
#' used if the transformation is performed based a single marker.
#'  
#' @param L `numeric` a single value that defines the total length (in mm) of 
#' the capillary that was used for CE(-MS) analysis. Is only used if the 
#' transformation is performed based on a single marker.
#'
#' @return `numeric` vector of same length as x with effective mobility values.
